# ThreeJS-HelloWorld

A simple example demonstrating a spinning cube using HTML5, CSS, and Three.js.

## Run the Demo

To run the demo, just `clone` this repo and open the `src/index.html` file in your browser of choice!

## Concept
1. Create a new, empty **Scene** (with a Camera and a Renderer)
2. Create a **Mesh** (that uses a Geometry and a Material)
3. Create the **Render Loop** (that calls Renderer.render())
4. ...and **call** the Render Loop to start!
